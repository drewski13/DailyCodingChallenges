'''
The question we'll work through is the following: return a new sorted merged list from K sorted lists,
each with size N. Before we move on any further, you should take some time to think about the solution!

First, go through an example. This buys time, makes sure you understand the problem, and lets you gain some intuition
for the problem. For example, if we had [[10, 15, 30], [12, 15, 20], [17, 20, 32]], the result should be [10, 12, 15,
15, 17, 20, 20, 30, 32].

Next, give any solution you can think of (even if it's brute force). It seems obvious that if we just flattened the
lists and sorted it, we would get the answer we want. The time complexity for that would be O(KN log KN),
since we have K * N total elements.

The third step is to think of pseudocodeâ€”a high-level solution for the problem. This is where we explore different
solutions. The things we are looking for are better space/time complexities but also the difficulty of the
implementation. You should be able to finish the solution in 30 minutes. Here, we can see that we only need to look
at K elements in each of the lists to find the smallest element initially. Heaps are great for finding the smallest
element. Let's say the smallest element is E. Once we get E, we know we're interested in only the next element of the
list that held E. Then we'd extract out the second smallest element and etc. The time complexity for this would be O(
KN log K), since we remove and append to the heap K * N times.

NOTE: this solution was written before their ANSWER in an email i read from them. Perhaps its not as 'efficient'
    [*] ill put their solution in a comment at the bottom of this script for FULL DISCLOSURE
